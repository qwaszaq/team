LOCATION: /Users/artur/coursor-agents-destiny-folder

INSTRUCTIONS: Read and follow the complete evaluation guide located at:
/Users/artur/coursor-agents-destiny-folder/EVALUATOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md

Your evaluation process:
1. Read EVALUATOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md completely

4. Document all outputs and evidence
5. Calculate scores using provided rubrics
6. Answer the core question about context capacity

Key principles:
- Be OBJECTIVE: Base conclusions on test results, not documentation
- Be HONEST: Report both strengths and weaknesses
- Be THOROUGH: Run all tests, don't skip stages
- Be EVIDENCE-BASED: Every claim must have test output to back it
- Distinguish CAPACITY (what it can hold) from USAGE (what it currently holds)

Time required: Approximately 3 hours for complete evaluation

Begin by reading EVALUATOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md and following it step by step.
