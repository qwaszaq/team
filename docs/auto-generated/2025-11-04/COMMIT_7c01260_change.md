## 📝 Commit Message

**research: Face Recognition Open Source Software Analysis**

## User Request
"Research cutting-edge open source face recognition software that can be
installed locally. Must be open source, cutting edge, works with images
and videos. Deep dive analysis."

## Workflow Demonstration
This research demonstrates the NEW Transparency + Cross-Team system:

1. User request received by Orchestrator (Aleksander/Claude)
2. Briefing created for Analytical Team
3. Tasks assigned to 5 team members:
   - Elena Volkov: OSINT research
   - Sofia Martinez: Market analysis
   - Maya Patel: Data analysis & comparison
   - Damian Rousseau: Critical review
   - Lucas Rivera: Report synthesis
4. Work tracked in real-time via dashboard
5. Results delivered with formal handoff
