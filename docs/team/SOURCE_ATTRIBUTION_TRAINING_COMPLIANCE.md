**Sample Citation (Exercise - Challenging a Source):**
```markdown
**Challenged Claim:** "Land value increased due to insider information"
**Analysis of Supporting Sources:**

**Source A:** Tabloid Article
**Publication:** Example Tabloid Weekly
**URL:** https://tabloid.pl/article/insider-scandal
**Date Accessed:** 2025-11-04
**Archive:** ./sources/news_articles/tabloid_001.html
**Credibility Assessment:** LOW
**Reasoning:**
  - Sensationalist headline
  - Anonymous sources ("sources close to the matter")
  - No verifiable facts
  - Known for lack of fact-checking
  - No corroboration from reputable outlets
**Verification Attempted:** Cross-referenced with 3 major outlets - NOT confirmed
**Alternative Explanation:** Market forces (infrastructure projects increase land values)

**Source B:** Expert Opinion - Economist Interview
**Publication:** Rzeczpospolita Business
**Expert:** Prof. Jan Kowalski, Warsaw School of Economics
**URL:** https://rp.pl/business/interview-land-expert
**Date:** 2024-11-01
**Archive:** ./sources/news_articles/rzeczpospolita_expert.html
**Credibility:** HIGH
**Expert Credentials:** Verified professor, 20+ years real estate economics
**Statement:** "Land near planned infrastructure typically appreciates 30-50% 
              even before construction begins due to market expectations"
**Assessment:** Provides alternative explanation (market forces vs. insider info)

**Critical Analysis:**
- Tabloid claim: NOT verified, LOW credibility
- Expert opinion: Provides legitimate alternative explanation
- Conclusion: Insufficient evidence for "insider information" claim
- Recommendation: Report only verified facts, note alternative explanations
