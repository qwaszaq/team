## 💡 What's Happening Behind the Scenes

While you watch:

1. **Each agent initializes** with their memory and task queue
2. **Aleksander assigns tasks** to each agent in sequence
3. **Each agent:**
   - Receives the task
   - Loads relevant context from memory (Qdrant, PostgreSQL, Neo4j)
   - Processes using their specialized methods
   - Produces domain-specific output
   - Saves to memory (all 4 databases via Helena)
4. **Next agent gets context** from previous agents' work
5. **Sequential dependencies** are shown explicitly

**You're watching REAL multi-agent collaboration!**

---

## 🎯 What This Proves

By the end, you'll have witnessed:

✅ **All 9 agents working** (not just 2-3)  
✅ **Sequential workflow** (not parallel)  
✅ **Real dependencies** (each builds on previous)  
✅ **Aleksander orchestrating** (true coordination)  
✅ **Different outputs per agent** (proof of specialization)  
✅ **Complete project lifecycle** (research → design → build → test)  

**This is the ultimate proof that agents work as a REAL team!**
