## 📝 Commit Message

**fix: Resolve false-positive warnings in database connectivity checks**

## Problem
PostgreSQL and Redis connectivity checks were showing ⚠️ warnings despite
services being healthy and fully operational. This was misleading and
suggested system issues when none existed.

## Root Cause (Multi-Agent Investigation)
- **Piotr (DevOps)**: Identified that ports 5432 and 6379 were OPEN
- **Tomasz (Developer)**: Discovered macOS 'timeout' command was corrupting exit codes
- The timeout command was causing nc/redis-cli to fail even on successful connections

## Solution Implemented
1. **Removed problematic timeout command**
   - Services respond instantly, timeout unnecessary
   - Timeout was breaking exit code handling on macOS

2. **Improved PostgreSQL check**
   - Use nc with pro"
