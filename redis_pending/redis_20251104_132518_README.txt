**Complete transparency and coordination tools for Destiny Team**

## What's This?

Tools that help YOU (as orchestrator) coordinate Core Team + Analytical Team effectively.

**Problem it solves:**
```
Before: "What is everyone doing? I don't know!"
After:  Dashboard shows exactly who's doing what, progress %, handoffs, etc.
```
